# Drug Screen Data Example Configuration
# 
# Input format
# ------------
# Due to the different types of modeling scenarios one might desire to perform,
# snakes supports several possible formats for the response data. In general,
# the type of data format expected depends on two considerations:
#
#   1) The number of individual models that should be built
#   2) The number of input dimensions per model
#
# To illustrate this, below are some hypothetical example response datasets 
# that could be used:
#
#     Experiment design                                     # Models  |  # Dims
#    ------------------                                     --------  |  ------
#   - A 1d response vector for a single drug model             1      |    1
#   - A 1d response vector for multiple models                many    |    1
#   - A multivariable response matrix for a single model       1      |   many
#   - Multivariable response matrices for n models            many    |   many
# 
# At present, for each case where there are multiple dimensions associated with
# a single model (e.g. cell viability at 10 different doses for a single drug/
# sample combo), it is assumed that dimension reduction is to be performed in
# or to arrive at a univariate response distribution.
#
# For the "many/many" case, the input response table is expected to have
# multiple rows for each observation / sample -- each row contains variables
# associated with a single model (e.g. drug). In all other cases, the response
# data is expected to be formatted such that each row represents a single
# sample or observation.
